# Grocery-Retail-Sales-Analysis

This presentation uses Data Analysis techniques to answer such questions that will enable better decision making in the grocery retail.
This was a prompt in the 3rd UW Datathon organized by Dubstech where my team secured the second place.

* What trends do you notice for the store with respect to transactions?

* What trends do you notice for the store with respect to time?

* What trends do you notice with respect to the categories & items listed? 

* Are there any categories or items the store should immediately focus on? 

* Given Inventory levels, price, rate of purchase etc., what are some (1 to 2) products that can be considered for a price reduction? 

* Give a sales analysis report answering fundamental questions that the store owner wants to know: 

* The highest selling products by month and category

* The least selling products by month and category

* The most profitable month by sales

* What are the most efficient ways that the store can reduce losses
